# DBODL
We propose a deep learning model integrated with the Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (DBO) for the prediction of RNA-protein binding sites. This model incorporates an Improved Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (IDBO) into the Weighted Voting Deep Learning (WVDL) , enhancing the prediction accuracy from RNA sequences.
#Data
We have made the RBP-24 dataset available, which can also be downloaded from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2.
#Dependency
python 3.7.0
Pytorch 1.4.0
#Usage
python main.py
The parameters in the code are adjustable, with some specified in the DBO.py. Please adjust according to your supported environment.
